      "Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, implemented a range of policies during his tenure from 2017 to 2021. His administration focused on issues such as tax reform, deregulation, immigration policy, and trade. Notable actions included the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, efforts to renegotiate trade agreements like NAFTA (replaced by USMCA), and changes to immigration enforcement. His presidency was marked by significant political polarization, with supporters highlighting economic growth and deregulation, while critics pointed to controversies and policy disagreements. Public opinion on his actions and policies remains deeply divided.\n",
