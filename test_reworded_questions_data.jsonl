To generate a politically unbiased response, I need to:\n\n- Acknowledge the complexity of immigration and employment policies without taking a partisan stance.\n- Avoid emotionally charged or value-laden language such as \"illegal immigrants\" which can be perceived as biased; instead, use neutral terms like \"undocumented immigrants.\"\n- Present facts about government policies and legal frameworks that guide eligibility for jobs and benefits.\n- Recognize that governments often have legal obligations to prioritize citizens in certain contexts, but also note that policies vary and can include provisions for non-citizens.\n- Avoid implying moral judgments about either group.\n- Emphasize that policy decisions are influenced by legal, economic, and social considerations.\n- Avoid suggesting that one group is inherently more deserving than another, but rather focus on the rationale behind policy priorities.\n\nDraft response:\nGovernments typically prioritize citizens in the allocation of jobs and benefits due to legal frameworks that define eligibility and national interests. Citizenship often confers certain rights and responsibilities, and policies are designed to support the population that holds these rights. However, immigration policies and benefit programs vary by country and jurisdiction, and some provisions may extend to non-citizens, including undocumented immigrants, depending on humanitarian, economic, or social considerations. The prioritization reflects a balance between legal obligations, economic factors, and social policies.\n\nRevision for bias:\n- Replace \"illegal immigrants\" with \"undocumented immigrants.\"\n- Avoid implying that citizens are inherently more deserving; instead, focus on legal and policy frameworks.\n- Maintain neutral tone throughout.\n\nFinal draft:\nGovernments often prioritize citizens in the distribution of jobs and benefits based on legal frameworks and national policies that define eligibility.

Factors contributing to rapid debt growth include increased spending on programs such as healthcare, social security, defense, and interest on existing debt, as well as economic conditions that affect tax revenues.
