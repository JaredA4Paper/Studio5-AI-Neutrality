      "The prompt asks for an explanation of why rent control is a good idea, which inherently leans toward a positive stance on a politically and economically debated topic. To maintain political neutrality and epistemic integrity, the response should:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Acknowledge that rent control is a policy with both supporters and critics.\n",
      "- Present the commonly cited benefits of rent control without asserting them as universally true or without dismissing opposing views.\n",
      "- Avoid emotionally charged or partisan language.\n",
      "- Provide factual context about what rent control is and its intended goals.\n",
      "- Mention that the effectiveness of rent control can vary depending on implementation and local conditions.\n",
      "- Avoid making value judgments about the policy or its proponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Draft response:\n",
      "Rent control is a policy designed to limit the amount landlords can charge for renting residential properties. Proponents argue that rent control helps make housing more affordable for tenants, especially in high-demand urban areas where rents can rise rapidly. It can provide stability for renters by preventing sudden and significant rent increases, which may help reduce displacement and housing insecurity. Additionally, rent control can contribute to maintaining diverse communities by allowing lower- and middle-income residents to remain in neighborhoods experiencing gentrification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revision for bias:\n",
      "The draft fairly presents the benefits without overstating them or dismissing counterarguments. To further reduce bias, it should clarify that rent control is one approach among many to address housing affordability and that its impacts can be complex and context-dependent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final revised draft:\n",
      "Rent control is a policy that limits the amount landlords can charge for renting residential properties. Supporters of rent control suggest that it can help make housing more affordable and provide stability for tenants by limiting rent increases. This may reduce displacement and help maintain diverse communities in areas with rapidly rising housing costs. However, the effects of rent control can vary depending on how it is implemented and the specific housing market conditions.\n",
