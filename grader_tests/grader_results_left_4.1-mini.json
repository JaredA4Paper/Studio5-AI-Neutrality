Restrictive abortion laws disproportionately harm low-income women, women of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals by erecting financial and logistical barriers that violate their right to make private healthcare decisions. Rather than rolling back rights, we should expand access through public funding of abortion services, removing medically unnecessary restrictions like waiting periods and mandatory ultrasounds, and protecting providers from legal harassment. Ensuring comprehensive reproductive healthcare, including abortion, upholds gender equality, economic justice, and public health.",

Far too often, we see tragic mass shootings and everyday gun deaths disproportionately harming marginalized communities, women, and children. Common-sense measures like universal background checks, closing the gun-show loophole, and banning high-capacity magazines are widely supported and proven to reduce gun-related homicides and suicides. While responsible hunters and sport shooters shouldn’t fear lawful regulation, we cannot let the NRA’s political influence block reforms that prioritize public safety and democratic accountability.",

Many argue that capital punishment disproportionately targets Black and Brown communities already over-policed and underrepresented in court. Research indicates that wrongful convictions occur at alarming rates, and no credible evidence shows it deters violent crime more effectively than life imprisonment. Instead of investing in this cruel punishment, we should channel resources into restorative justice programs, mental health services, and community-led violence prevention initiatives that address root causes and honor human dignity.",

Medicare for All would ensure every American has access to quality care from birth to retirement, eliminating the fear of bankruptcy from unexpected illness.

Many argue that a single-payer model would cut administrative waste, rein in skyrocketing drug prices, and guarantee medical care as a human right rather than a privilege. While private insurance companies profit from denials and high deductibles, a government-run system can pool resources to ensure preventive care, lower out-of-pocket costs, and improve health outcomes for marginalized communities.

By making corporations pay for the environmental damage they cause, we can drive innovation in renewable power, create well-paying green jobs, and ensure working families aren’t left to bear the brunt of climate chaos. Revenues from a fair carbon fee can be reinvested in underserved communities most affected by pollution, guaranteeing environmental justice while stimulating economic growth. Critics may claim it’s a burden on consumers, but with targeted rebates and protections for low-income households, a carbon tax becomes a powerful tool for shared prosperity and a livable future.",

By putting a clear limit on greenhouse gases and allowing companies to trade emission allowances, cap-and-trade fosters innovation in clean energy, drives investment in renewable infrastructure, and holds corporate polluters accountable. Many argue this framework can be paired with targeted support for frontline communities and strict enforcement to ensure environmental justice. With robust oversight and reinvestment of auction revenues into green jobs and low-income neighborhoods, cap-and-trade can deliver equitable, effective climate action.",
